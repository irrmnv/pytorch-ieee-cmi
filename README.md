The code is based on [Andres solution](https://github.com/antorsae/sp-society-camera-model-identification) for [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sp-society-camera-model-identification) with changes made to improve performance and readability.

This repository is no longer supported. I recommend using [the following repository](https://github.com/PavelOstyakov/camera_identification/).
